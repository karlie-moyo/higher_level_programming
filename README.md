This repository contains programs created for the _**Software Engineering Higher Level** Programing._ Now on Higher Level Programming, Your girl here is ready for collaborations. Hey you! Come let's do hard things. The following is a specific list of projects and what I have learnt so far:

| PR.NO | PROJECT                                                                                 | DESCRIPTION |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0x00  | [Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world/)                                     | The Python Hello World program demonstrates basic syntax, with the print() function outputting a string to the console.            |
| 0x01  | [Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/)            | If/else handles conditions, **loops** repeat tasks, and **functions** allow code reuse in Python.            |
| 0x02  | [Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules/)                              | Import allows you to use external code and modules to organize and reuse functionality in Python. You can import whole modules, specific functions, or create your own.           |
| 0x03  | [Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures/)               | Lists are ordered, mutable data structures that can store different data types and be modified. **Tuples** are ordered, immutable structures, meaning once created, they cannot be changed. Lists are flexible, while tuples are useful for fixed data.            |
| 0x04  | [Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./0x04-python-more_data_structures/)   | Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, with no duplicates allowed. Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, where keys are unique, and they provide fast lookups by key.            |
| 0x05  | [Python - Exceptions](./0x05-python-exceptions/)                                        | Python exceptions provide a mechanism for handling errors. The try-except block catches exceptions, while else and finally blocks handle post-execution and cleanup. You can also raise and define custom exceptions to manage specific error cases.            |
| 0x06  | [Python - Classes and Objects](./0x06-python-classes/)                                  | Python classes allow you to create custom objects with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Classes support key concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The __init__ method initializes objects, and methods define their behavior.            |
| 0x07  | [Python - Test-driven development](./0x07-python-test_driven_development/)              | Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python involves writing tests first, then coding the solution to pass the tests, followed by refactoring. It uses tools like unittest and pytest for creating and running tests, leading to better code quality, confidence, and maintaina            |
| 0x08  | [Python - More Classes and Objects](./0x08-python-more_classes/)                        | In Python, **classes** define **objects** with **attributes** (data) and **methods** (behavior). **Instance attributes** are object-specific, while **class attributes** are shared. **Class methods** affect the class, and **static methods** don’t depend on the class or instance. **Inheritance** allows a class to inherit behaviors from another class.            |
| 0x09  | [Python - Everything is object](./0x09-python-everything_is_object/)                    | Everything (including data types like integers, strings, and functions) is an instance of a class, with its own attributes and methods. This allows Python to treat all data uniformly and enables features like dynamic typing and object-oriented programming.            |
| 0x0A  | [Python - Inheritance](./0x0A-python-inheritance/)                                      | **Inheritance** in Python allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. It promotes code reuse, and the child class can override or extend the parent's behavior. Python supports **multiple inheritance**, where a class can inherit from more than one class.            |
| 0x0B  | [Python - Input/Output](./0x0B-python-input_output/)                                    | **Input and Output** in Python involves using `input()` to take user input and `print()` to display output. File operations use `open()` to read from and write to files.            |
| 0x0C  | [Python - Almost_a_circle](./0x0C-python-almost_a_circle/)                              | The "Almost a Circle" project involves approximating a circle using characters in a grid, typically by checking if points on the grid satisfy the circle's equation. It’s a common exercise in working with ASCII art or basic geometry in programming.            |
| 0x0D  | [SQL - Introduction](./0x0D-SQL_introduction/)                                          | SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows operations like retrieving data (`SELECT`), adding (`INSERT`), updating (`UPDATE`), and deleting (`DELETE`) records, as well as filtering (`WHERE`), sorting (`ORDER BY`), and joining tables (`JOIN`).            |
| 0x0E  | [SQL - More_queries](./0x0E-SQL_more_queries/)                                          | SQL More Queries include advanced techniques like using **DISTINCT** for unique values, **AND**, **OR**, **NOT** for combining conditions, and **BETWEEN** or **IN** for range and list filtering. It also covers aggregate functions like **COUNT**, **SUM**, **AVG**, and **MIN/MAX**, as well as using **HAVING** with **GROUP BY**. **JOINs** combine data from multiple tables, and **ALTER TABLE** modifies table structure.            |
| 0x0F  | [Python - Object-relational_mapping](./0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping/)          | **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** in Python allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects instead of SQL queries. It maps database tables to Python classes and supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Popular ORM libraries include **SQLAlchemy** and **Django ORM**.            |
| 0x10  | [Python - Network #0](./0x10-python-network_0/)                                         | Python networking involves using libraries like **socket** and **requests** to create networked applications. **Socket** enables low-level communication over TCP/IP, while **requests** is used for making HTTP requests. Python also supports higher-level protocols and APIs for tasks like web scraping, sending emails, and connecting to databases.            |
| 0x11  | [Python - Network #1](./0x11-python-network_1/)                                         | **Python Network 1** covers basic socket programming, where a server listens for client connections and clients communicate over TCP/IP. The `socket` library is used to create connections, send, and receive data.            |
| 0x12  | [JavaScript - Warm_up](./0x12-javascript-warm_up/)                                      | **JavaScript Warm-up** focuses on getting familiar with the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, operators, and simple control structures like loops and conditionals. It helps in understanding how to manipulate data and interact with the document using JavaSc        |
| 0x13  | [JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures](./0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures/) | JavaScript **objects** store data as key-value pairs, **scopes** define variable visibility, and **closures** allow functions to access variables from their outer scope even after the outer function finishes. 
| 0x14  | [javascript-web_scraping](0x14-javascript-web_scraping)                                  | **JS Scraping** involves using JavaScript to extract data from websites, often with tools like **Puppeteer** or **Cheerio** for automating browsing and collecting content.
| 0x15  | [Javascript-web_jquery](./0x15-javascript-web_jquery/)                                   | **jQuery** is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies tasks like DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests. It allows developers to write less code to achieve common tasks across browsers.
